Changelog jmacaroons
=====================

Version 0.4.0 (????-??-??)
--------------------------

   ! Fix spelling mistake satisfyExcact -> satisfyExact (breaking API change, but fixes this jarring typo)


Version 0.3.1 (2014-12-19)
--------------------------

   * Fixed: a bug in verifying third-party caveats, they aren't optional but mandatory


Version 0.3.0 (2014-12-06)
--------------------------

   + Added: AuthoritiesCaveatVerifier to verify given authorities, which is a common use case
   + Added: not only strings but also byte arrays may be used as secret keys
   * Catched up latest changes from libmacaroons (2014-10-05 hash 568ff74, vid isn't encoded as base64, but raw)
   * Improved performance via clone HMAC tool, because its 25% faster than creating a new one via 'getInstance()'
   ! Serialization uses Base64 URL safe encoding (RFC 4648). This follows libmacaroons implementation,
     but may break compatibility to older libs. For backward compatibility, De-Serialization accepts both base64 standards.

--------------------------

   + Added: adding third party caveats to macaroons is possible
   + Added: verifying third party caveats on macaroons is possible
