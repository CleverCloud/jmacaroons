Macaroons are Better Than Cookies!
==================================

This Java library provides an implementation of macaroons[1], which are flexible
authorization tokens that work great in distributed systems.  Like cookies,
macaroons are bearer tokens that enable applications to ascertain whether their
holders' actions are authorized.  But macaroons are better than cookies!
